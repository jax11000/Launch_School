Question 1
answer
the ids change when the values change

Question 2
Answer
ids change with each method because it is technically a different variable due to method variable scope

Question 3
Answer
the string does not concatenate the rutebaga because in the method it is reassigned to rutebaga as a different variable. 
the method forgets about the original parameter given and treats this new string as the 'true' string. 
while the array can hold a number of elements and the << is simply adding more to the original parameter passed in
it is not changing the initial parameter because ruby keeps using the same element we passed in adding more elements to it. 


Question 4
Answer
because in the method the string is now having << called on it, it is using the original object and adding to it
rather than creating an entirely new object due to reassignment. while the array is now being set = to the new
elements being added, the original object has now been forgotten about by the method and because of method variable
scope it will not be displayed on the outside of the method. instead it will be the original object given.
