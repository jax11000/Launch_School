6.) What does the following error message tell you? 
ArgumentError: wrong number of arguments (1 for 2)
  from (irb):1:in `calculate_product'
  from (irb):4
  from /Users/username/.rvm/rubies/ruby-2.0.0-p353/bin/irb:12:in `<main>'


This tells me that there were the wrong number of arguments given to the calculate_product method. it appears as though calculate_product is on line one and that it was given one argument instead of two.
